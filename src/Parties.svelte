        Here at Tony's we believe in celebrating our big accomplishments.
        Hopefully you do too! We offer party events where you can invite family
        and friends to celebrate your or someone dear's special day. Simply contact us
        with a time and date, and we'll set it up for you! Within Delano, you have two
        options: our Tony's Pizza on Cecil Avenue or our Tony's Firehouse Grill and Pizza 
        on County Line Road.
